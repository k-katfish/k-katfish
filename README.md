- 👋 Hi, I’m @k-katfish
- You can find more on my website: <https://kkatfish.com/resume>
- 🖥️ I am a Windows and Linux System Administrator, with experience in Microsoft Server Active Directory, Enterprise Linux server administration, and more.
- 👀 I’m interested in CyberSecurity, Networking, Software Development, and all things computers!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a whole lot. I'm studying Computer Science with a concentration in Networks and CyberSecurity at Colorado State University. Right now that includes:
  - Test Driven Devlopment with CS415
  - Web Design and Development with CS315
- C#️⃣: I'm currently teaching myself C# as I write the next version of Push.
- ⚒️ I’m currently working on:
  - Push 3.0: A lovely tool for installing software on one, more, or many Windows computers in a Domain. You can utilize existing infrastructure of MDT to install (now or later) one (or more) pieces of software on one (or more) computers. Plus, use ScanHost to get a quick bunch of information about a remote computer, and FindUsers to quickly find who is currently logged in and where.
  - HP-BRMT (HP BIOS Remote Managment Toolkit) which is a GUI for managing the BIOS on any HP computer. You can run it on 'this computer', or connect to another HP computer, and manage that BIOS as well! @HP - I'd love to come work for you
- 📫 How to reach me: kyle.ketchell@proton.me .
- 👨‍💻 I made a tool called Push, which can remotely install software on one, more, or many Windows computers in a Domain. The idea is that it will be a handy tool for IT admins who need to install software on many machines.
