- 🖥️ I am a Windows and Linux System Administrator, with experience in Microsoft Server Active Directory, Enterprise Linux server administration, and more.
- 👀 I’m interested in CyberSecurity, Networking, Linux, and all things computers!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Cisco routers and Network Administration.
- C#️⃣: I'm currently teaching myself C# as I write the next version of Push.
- ⚒️ I’m currently working on:
  - Push 3.0: A lovely tool for installing software on one, more, or many Windows computers in a Domain. You can utilize existing infrastructure of MDT to install (now or later) one (or more) pieces of software on one (or more) computers. Plus, use ScanHost to get a quick bunch of information about a remote computer, and FindUsers to quickly find who is currently logged in and where.

- 👨‍💻 I made a tool called Push, which can remotely install software on one, more, or many Windows computers in a Domain. The idea is that it will be a handy tool for IT admins who need to install software on many machines.
