- 👋 Hi, I’m @k-katfish
- 👀 I’m interested in CyberSecurity, Networking, IOT devices, software-for-hardware, and all things computers!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a whole lot! I'm studying Computer Science with a concentration in Networks and CyberSecurity at Colorado State University.
- ⚒️ I’m currently working on an application called Push, which can remotely install software on one, more, or many Windows computers in a Domain. The idea is that it will be a handy tool for IT admins who need to install software on many machines.
- 📫 How to reach me: kkatfish@cs.colostate.edu, or kkatfish@colostate.edu. If you're looking for something more professional, kyle.ketchelL@colostate.edu works too.
